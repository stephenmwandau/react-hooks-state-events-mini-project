# Putting it All Together: State and Events

## Learning Goals

- Use state and events to make components dynamic
- Implement controlled components

## Introduction

To build on what you've learned over the course of this section, we'll be
building out a simple task list app to practice working with state and events,
focusing in particular on working with arrays.

## Deliverables

There is some starter code built out for all of the components you'll need. The
data for the application is imported in `App`, so you'll need to pass that data
down to the components that need it as props.

Run `npm install` and `npm start`, then check out the starter code in the
browser.
